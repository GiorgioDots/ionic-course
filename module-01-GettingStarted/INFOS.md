# Comparing Ionic to Alternatives

You can build mobile apps with cross-platform technologies (like HTML, JS, CSS) with other technologies, too. React Native comes to mind for example.

Here's my detailed comparison of all these popular approaches: https://academind.com/learn/flutter/react-native-vs-flutter-vs-ionic-vs-nativescript-vs-pwa/

# The Course Source Code
If you're facing issues or you're getting error messages, __compare your code to mine__! History shows that pretty much all issues can be solved by doing that.

You find my code attached to multiple lectures per module and always to the last lecture of each module (this lecture here is an exception - we simply got no important code in this first section).

Once you downloaded + extracted the attachments, you can run `npm install` followed by `ionic serve` (later, once we added the Ionic CLI) to run the code examples.
